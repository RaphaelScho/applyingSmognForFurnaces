## Testing and adapting SMOGN for the FURNACES project
Sample data for running the code can be found in /data. The final results were generated with a data set that follows 
the same structure as the data available in /data, but is too large to upload.

All code can be run from the provided Jupyter notebooks, which also provide visualisations of the results.

The set of used packages can be found in requirements.txt.
